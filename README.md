# Turtle Crossing Game

Turtle Crossing is a simple game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game provides a fun interface where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with cars. The objective is to safely navigate the turtle to the other side of the road without getting hit by any cars.

- Avoid colliding with the cars while crossing the road.
- Successfully reach the other side to score points.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with any of the cars.
